# COVID-19-Analysis-using-Python

## Key Analysis Components:

* Case Trends: The project tracks the spread of the virus over time, specifically analyzing confirmed cases, recoveries, and fatalities to identify peak periods and flattening curves.
* Geographic Insights: It compares impact across different regions or countries (often focusing on India-specific data from Kaggle or WHO) to highlight hotspots.
* Vaccination Progress: Many iterations of this project include a secondary analysis of vaccination rates vs. daily infection numbers to evaluate the efficacy of rollout programs.

## Technical Workflow:

* Pandas: Used for data cleaning, such as handling missing date values and calculating 7-day rolling averages to smooth out daily reporting spikes.
* Seaborn & Matplotlib: The project utilizes these for multi-line plots (comparing cases vs. deaths) and heatmaps to show the intensity of the outbreak in specific provinces or states.
* Interactive Visuals: Some files utilize Plotly Express to create animated geographic maps that show how the virus moved globally from 2020 through 2021.
